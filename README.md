# Chippit - a CHIP-8 emulator
## The project
This is a playground for emulation studying. Currently the plan is to implement an interpreter for CHIP-8 programs.
## TODOs
- ~~Complete the skeleton~~
- Implement all the opcodes and font display
- Re-evaulate architecture
- Rewrite rendering, so it will be based on rectangles and scaled to a screen properly
